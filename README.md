# rascal-language-server

Experimental project that aims to provide a [language server](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol) for [Rascal](http://www.rascal-mpl.org/).

## How to run

Please note that there isn't any usable functionality (yet) for now.

1. Install the 'vscode-client' plugin for Visual Studio Code so that it can connect to a running language server

    ```cd vscode-client && npm install .```

1. Make sure [rls-tunnel.py](experiments/rls-tunnel.py) is in your $PATH. Alternatively, compile rls-tunnel.c and put the executable there instead.
1. Load the LanguageServer module in either the Rascal CLI REPL or the Rascal Eclipse plugin console and register a language.
1. Run 'startServer();' (to stop, run 'stopServer();')
1. Start VS Code from the 'vscode-client' directory:

    ```npm run vscode```

    (For Windows, substitute vscode for vscode-windows)
1. Optional: click on 'Help' â†’ 'Toggle Developers Tools' (or press Ctrl+Shift+I) to view debugging tools.
